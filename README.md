# IsoArcher
IsoArcher is a collaboration game I made with my best friend Stephen Schaefer. He worked on the art side of things, while I worked on programming. It's a simple game about shooting goblins with arrows, and using gold to upgrade your weapon. This was also my first time coding a game in C#.
