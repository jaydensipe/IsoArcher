# üèπ IsoArcher üèπ

IsoArcher is a collaborative game I made with my best friend Stephen Schaefer. He worked on the art side of things, while I worked on programming. It's a simple game about shooting goblins with arrows and using gold to upgrade your weapon. This was our first-time working experimenting with a 3D environment, as well as creating a game in C#. This game taught me a lot about collaboratively working with another person, and how to structure the game based on that fact.
