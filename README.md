# üèπ IsoArcher üèπ

IsoArcher is a collaborative game I made with my best-friend Stephen Schaefer. He worked on the art side of things, while I worked on programming. It's a simple game about shooting goblins with arrows, and using gold to upgrade your weapon. This was my first time working in a 3D environment, as well as creating a game in C#. This particular game taught me a lot about working with another person, and how to structure the game based on that fact.
